# Community Incentive Programs

## Background

We invite different people to contribute to our projects in various ways in exchange for the future Desmos tokens. On one hand, this will enrich our project by including people and ideas from all over the world. On the other hand, this will also help us to make the initial token distribution more decentralized.
