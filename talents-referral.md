## Introduction

As an early-stage startup from Hong Kong, we are an outlier in the blockchain space. Forbole is currently ranked 11th in terms of voting power on the validator set of Cosmos Hub. We have built [Big Dipper](http://cosmos.bigdipper.live), which is used by people from 135 countries all over the world. Now we are developing a more ambitious project called Desmos.

To build a great and significant blockchain project, we need a diversified and distributed culture. We need to do it as early as possible before our culture has become too ingrained to evolve. As such, we are building our early team which we hope to be distributed across the globe. To achieve this, we need your help.
